## Course Description

hƿæt ƿe gardena in geardagum þeodcyninga þrym gefrunon hu ða æþelingas ellen fremedon…

Those are the first words of the Old English epic *Beowulf,* and in this class, you will learn to read them. The language of Rohan in the novels of Tolkien, Old English speaks of long, cold, and lonely winters; of haunting beauty found in unexpected places; and of unshakable resolve in the face of insurmountable odds. It is, in short, the perfect language for MIT students.

After quickly learning the basics of grammar and vocabulary, we will read greatest (bloodiest) hits from the epic *Beowulf* as well as moving laments, the personified Cross's first-person account of the Crucifixion, and riddles whose solutions range from the sacred to the obscene.
