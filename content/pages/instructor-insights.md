How the Course Has Evolved

Plans for Future Iterations of the Course

### **Curriculum Information**

#### **Prerequisites**

- [*8.02 Physics II: Electricity And Magnetism*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-02-physics-ii-electricity-and-magnetism-spring-2007/)*, 8.021 Physics II: Electricity And Magnetism,* or [*8.022 Physics II: Electricity And Magnetism*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-022-physics-ii-electricity-and-magnetism-fall-2004/)
- [*18.03 Differential Equations*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011/) or *18.032 Differential Equations*

#### **Requirements Satisfied**

- 12.006J can be applied toward a [Bachelor of Science in Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences with a concentration in Planetary Science and Astronomy](https://twelve.mit.edu/mitcourse12/degree-chart/), but is not required.
- 12.006J can be applied toward a [Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering](http://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/mechanical-engineering-course-2/), but is not required.
- 12.006J can be applied toward a [Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with a concentration in Applied Mathematics](https://math.mit.edu/academics/undergrad/major/course18/applied.html), but is not required.

#### **Offered**

Once a year, in the fall semester

### **Assessment and Grading**

Studentsâ€™ grades were based on the following activities:

- 80% Problem sets
- 20% Final project

### **Student Information**

#### **Enrollment**

Fewer than 10 students

#### **Student Background**

About one-third of the students were Math majors, another third were either Physics or Earth and Planetary Sciences majors, and the remainder came from other departments. All students were familiar with ordinary differential equations; i.e., they had successfully completed 18.03.

### **How Student Time Was Spent**

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

#### **Lectures**

- Met twice per week for 1.5 hours per session; 26 sessions total; mandatory attendance.

#### **Out of Class**

- Outside of class, students completed the assigned problem sets and worked on their final project and presentation.
